Frame
First create a frame(baseFrame). Add menubar. Menu Items, click events etc.

Panel
Create a panel (basePanel). This will be the base pane for the frame. Create a splitpane and add it to the basepane.
now use the setLeftComponent(), and setRightComponent() methods.
To set the location of the divider use setDividerLocation(200) method.

Panels
There will be two panels, controlPanel, and propertyPanel.
Create two abstract panels, and add all the logic for them as a parent. Other panels will extend these panels and
call these methods to get their behavior.
