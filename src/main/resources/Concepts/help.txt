Concept is about building a selenium automation gui, something like Jmeter.
    - user creates a new project(Test Plan).
    - add components in the tree, in left panel
    - properties for each component of the tree in the right panel
    - The testPlan gets saved in a text file in simple xml or json format.
    
    - user can run the test, methods of each component in the tree gets executed.
    - logs, and results gets saved in text format specified.
    - Snapshots also gets saved, if option is clicked by the user.
    
    - user adds events to the page.
    - Test is executed based on the sequence the events are present.

Implementation Details.
    - A simple data structure which is self executable without any GUI.
    - The top Elements(eg TestPlan, Test) creates a Configuration Parcel to the lower elements(eg page).
    - based on the properties of the parcel's values as well as its own values, the test is executed.
    - The Datastructure is kept as simple as possible, and as less data as possible.
    - The dataStructure is integrated with the UI components
    - The Ui components interaction , and events handeling is important, which manipulated the actual data structure.
